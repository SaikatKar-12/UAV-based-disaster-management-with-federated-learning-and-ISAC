# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UAV-Based Disaster Imagery Analysis & Post-Rescue System is a comprehensive solution that enables rescue teams to efficiently locate and coordinate the rescue of survivors in disaster areas. The system leverages UAVs equipped with cameras and ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication) technology to adaptively transmit survivor detection data based on network conditions. The system includes AI-powered survivor detection, federated learning for model improvement, and a real-time dashboard for rescue team coordination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want to view a real-time dashboard showing survivor locations on a map, so that I can efficiently plan rescue operations and coordinate team deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rescue team member logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display an interactive disaster area map
2. WHEN survivors are detected by the UAV THEN the system SHALL display survivor locations as pins on the map with GPS coordinates
3. WHEN survivor data is updated THEN the map SHALL refresh automatically to show new detections
4. WHEN a survivor pin is clicked THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including confidence level and detection timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want to see the current ISAC communication mode and available data streams, so that I can understand what information is currently available from the UAV.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UAV is operating THEN the system SHALL display the current ISAC mode (Good Network, Medium Network, or Weak Network)
2. WHEN network conditions are good THEN the system SHALL show live video feed, survivor detections, and AI updates
3. WHEN network conditions are medium THEN the system SHALL show low-quality video feed and survivor detections
4. WHEN network conditions are weak THEN the system SHALL show only survivor coordinates and detection results
5. WHEN ISAC mode changes THEN the dashboard SHALL update the displayed information within 5 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want to view a list of detected survivors with their details, so that I can prioritize rescue operations based on confidence levels and locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN survivors are detected THEN the system SHALL display a list showing survivor ID, GPS coordinates, confidence percentage, and detection timestamp
2. WHEN multiple survivors are detected THEN the system SHALL sort the list by confidence level in descending order
3. WHEN survivor information is updated THEN the list SHALL refresh automatically
4. WHEN a survivor entry is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding location on the map

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want to mark survivors as rescued, so that I can prevent duplicate rescue missions and track rescue progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a survivor is successfully rescued THEN the rescue team member SHALL be able to mark the survivor as "rescued" in the dashboard
2. WHEN a survivor is marked as rescued THEN the system SHALL update the database to reflect the rescue status
3. WHEN a survivor is marked as rescued THEN the survivor SHALL be visually distinguished on the map (different color/icon)
4. WHEN viewing the survivor list THEN rescued survivors SHALL be clearly indicated and moved to a separate section

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a UAV operator, I want the system to automatically adapt data transmission based on network conditions, so that critical survivor information is always transmitted even with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network signal strength is good THEN the UAV SHALL transmit live video, survivor detections, and AI model updates
2. WHEN network signal strength is medium THEN the UAV SHALL transmit compressed video and survivor detections only
3. WHEN network signal strength is weak THEN the UAV SHALL transmit only survivor coordinates and detection confidence scores
4. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically switch transmission modes within 10 seconds
5. WHEN critical survivor data is detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize this data transmission regardless of network mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want survivor detection models to improve over time through federated learning, so that detection accuracy increases without compromising survivor privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UAVs collect detection data THEN the system SHALL use federated learning to improve AI models locally without transmitting raw imagery
2. WHEN model improvements are validated THEN the system SHALL update the detection algorithms across all UAVs
3. WHEN federated learning updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain survivor privacy by not sharing raw detection images
4. WHEN detection confidence improves THEN the system SHALL log accuracy metrics for performance monitoring

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want to authenticate securely into the system, so that sensitive disaster response information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the rescue team member SHALL be required to provide valid authentication credentials
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL grant access to the rescue dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the failed attempt
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log out the user and require re-authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a rescue team member, I want the system to store and retrieve historical rescue mission data, so that I can review past operations and improve future response strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rescue operations are conducted THEN the system SHALL store all survivor detections, rescue statuses, and mission timestamps in the database
2. WHEN requesting historical data THEN the system SHALL provide access to past mission logs and survivor information
3. WHEN viewing historical missions THEN the system SHALL display mission duration, number of survivors detected, and rescue success rates
4. WHEN exporting mission data THEN the system SHALL provide data in standard formats for analysis and reporting
